    "question": "What projects are available in our Benchling workspace? Show me the first 5 projects.",
    "answer": "Based on the Benchling API, there are 5 projects available in your workspace:\n\n1. **Sickle Cell - Mol Gen** (ID: project_id_1)\n2. **Yeast CRISPR** (ID: project_id_2)\n3. **PTC Project 2425** (ID: project_id_3) \n4. **ZELAR** (ID: src_Fq2naN3m)\n5. **PTC Sequences** (ID: project_id_5)\n\nThe ZELAR project (src_Fq2naN3m) contains various DNA sequences including the CRISPRoff-v2.1 plasmid.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What DNA sequences are in the ZELAR project?",
    "answer": "The ZELAR project (ID: src_Fq2naN3m) contains 8 DNA sequences:\n\n1. **JKNp112-CAG-Dnmt3A-3L-**\n2. **CRISPRoff-v2.1** (ID: seq_bsw5XEhW)\n3. **IGF1**\n4. **long_telomeres**\n5. **possible_cancer**\n6. **VEGFA**\n7. **Folistatin**\n8. **CONSTRUCT_1**\n\nThe CRISPRoff-v2.1 sequence is particularly notable as it's a plasmid that can be downloaded in GenBank format.",

  {
    "question": "Are there any notebook entries in the ZELAR project?",
    "answer": "The ZELAR project currently has no notebook entries. When I search for entries in the ZELAR project (ID: src_Fq2naN3m), the result shows 0 entries.",

    "question": "What folders are available in our Benchling workspace?",
    "answer": "There are 5 folders available in your Benchling workspace with the following IDs:\n\n1. **lib_W25gpt5R**\n2. **lib_cWioB7Wu**\n3. **lib_o88jH2P0**\n4. **lib_RvPlAq6S**\n5. **lib_Yj2NxcnS**\n\nThese folders help organize your biological data and sequences within the Benchling platform.",

  {
    "question": "Can you search for entities related to 'ZELAR'?",
    "answer": "When searching for entities related to 'ZELAR' across entry, DNA sequence, RNA sequence, and amino acid sequence types, no matching entities are found. This suggests that while the ZELAR project exists, there are no individual entities with 'ZELAR' in their names or metadata that match the search criteria.",

    "question": "Can you download the CRISPRoff-v2.1 sequence from the ZELAR project?",
    "answer": "Yes, I successfully downloaded the CRISPRoff-v2.1 sequence from the ZELAR project. Here are the details:\n\n- **Sequence ID**: seq_bsw5XEhW\n- **Sequence Name**: CRISPRoff-v2.1\n- **Format**: GenBank (auto-detected as plasmid)\n- **Length**: 11,885 base pairs\n- **File**: CRISPRoff-v21.gb\n- **Is Plasmid**: Yes\n\nThe sequence was downloaded in GenBank format because it was automatically detected as a plasmid. The file starts with the standard GenBank LOCUS header and contains the complete sequence with annotations.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if I try to download a sequence that doesn't exist?",
    "answer": "When attempting to download a non-existent sequence, the system will return an error indicating that the sequence was not found. The download operation will fail gracefully with an appropriate error message explaining that the specified sequence name could not be located in the given project.",

  },
  {
    "question": "Can you get details about a specific DNA sequence using its ID?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can retrieve detailed information about a specific DNA sequence using its ID. For example, using the sequence ID 'seq_bsw5XEhW' for the CRISPRoff-v2.1 sequence, I can get comprehensive details including:\n\n- Sequence name and description\n- Base sequence data\n- Length information\n- Associated project and folder\n- Creation and modification dates\n- Annotations and features\n- Registry information if applicable\n\nThis provides much more detailed information than the list view.",

  {
    "question": "What types of sequence formats can be downloaded from Benchling?",
    "answer": "Benchling supports downloading sequences in multiple formats:\n\n1. **FASTA format**: Standard sequence format with header and sequence data\n2. **GenBank format**: Comprehensive format with annotations, features, and metadata\n3. **Auto-detection**: The system can automatically choose the appropriate format based on sequence type\n   - Plasmids are typically downloaded in GenBank format for complete annotation data\n   - Linear sequences may default to FASTA format\n\nThe format can be specified during download, or you can use 'auto' to let the system choose the most appropriate format based on the sequence characteristics.",
