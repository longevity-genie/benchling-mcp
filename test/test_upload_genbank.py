"""Test for uploading, verifying, and deleting GenBank files in Benchling MCP Server.

This test demonstrates a complete workflow:
1. Upload a GenBank file to the ZELAR project
2. Verify the sequence exists in Benchling
3. Archive (delete) the uploaded sequence

Requirements:
- .env file with BENCHLING_API_KEY and BENCHLING_DOMAIN
- Access to the ZELAR project for upload permissions
- test_CRISPRoff-v21.gb file in the test directory
